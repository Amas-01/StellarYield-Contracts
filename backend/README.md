# StellarYield Backend

Express API for StellarYield. It indexes on-chain data, stores it in PostgreSQL,
and exposes REST endpoints for vault, user, and yield data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Local Setup With Docker Compose

From this `backend/` directory:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Check health:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Run database migrations once:

```sh
docker compose --profile migrate run --rm db-migrate
```

Stop services:

```sh
docker compose down
```

Remove the local PostgreSQL volume:

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

## Local Setup Without Docker

Create a local environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies, build, migrate, and start:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run db:migrate
npm start
```

For development with file watching:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `npm start` - run `node dist/index.js`.
- `npm run dev` - run the API with `tsx watch`.
- `npm run lint` - lint files under `src/`.
- `npm test` - run the Vitest suite.
- `npm run db:migrate` - apply `src/db/schema.sql` to PostgreSQL.
- `npm run db:migrate:down` - drop every table/view/type the migrations created (revert script).
- `npm run db:seed` - insert sample vault and user rows (idempotent; safe to run twice).
- `npm run indexer` - run the event indexer.
- `npm run operator-expiry-task` - run operator expiry background task.
- `npm run mock-rpc` - run the mock Soroban RPC server (see below).

## Mock Soroban RPC Server

Instead of pointing the API and indexer at testnet (slow and rate-limited), you
can run a local mock that answers the RPC methods they actually call:
`getHealth`, `getLatestLedger`, `getEvents`, and `simulateTransaction`.

```sh
npm run mock-rpc
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8001` (override with `MOCK_RPC_PORT`)
and answers JSON-RPC with data loaded from `dev/fixtures/*.json`
(`getHealth.json`, `getLatestLedger.json`, `getEvents.json`,
`simulateTransaction.json`). Edit those files to change the mock's chain tip,
event stream, or contract read results. `getEvents` fixture events are written
with plain native values (strings/numbers/arrays); the mock encodes them into
base64 XDR `ScVal`s so the Stellar SDK decodes them exactly like real chain
data. Methods outside the supported list get a standard JSON-RPC
`"Method not found"` error (`-32601`).

Then run the API or indexer against the mock:

```sh
STELLAR_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8001 npm run dev
STELLAR_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8001 npm run indexer
```

With the fixture events targeting the vault contract configured in
`VAULT_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` (and `DATABASE_URL` migrated), the indexer will
process the fixture `deposit`/`withdraw`/`yield_dis`/`st_chg` events on every
poll cycle — no network access needed.

## Environment Variables

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | HTTP server port. |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` | Runtime environment. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | none | PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | No | `testnet` | Stellar network name. |
| `STELLAR_RPC_URL` | No | Soroban testnet RPC | Stellar RPC endpoint. |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | No | Testnet passphrase | Network passphrase. |
| `VAULT_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` | **Recommended** | empty | Vault factory contract ID. **Required for event indexing.** If empty, the indexer will skip event polling and only update `indexer_state`, logging a warning at startup. |
| `ZKME_VERIFIER_CONTRACT_ID` | No | empty | zkMe verifier contract ID. |
| `INDEXER_START_LEDGER` | No | `0` | Ledger to begin indexing from. |
| `INDEXER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | No | `5000` | Indexer polling interval. |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | empty | Optional webhook signing secret. |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | No | empty | Admin API authentication key. |
| `KEY_INACTIVITY_DAYS` | No | unset (never) | Days an API key may go unused before the daily sweep deactivates it. Never-used keys are measured from `created_at`. Deactivated keys are rejected with 401, the same response as an unknown or expired key. |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `30000` | Longest a request may run before it gets a 503 with `Retry-After: 5`. SSE streams are exempt. |
| `LOAD_SHED_LAG_MS` | No | `250` | Event loop p99 lag, in ms, above which non-essential requests get a 503 with `Retry-After: 5`. `/health`, `/metrics` and `/api/v1/admin` are never shed. |
| `DEBUG_ARCHIVE_ROUTES` | No | empty | Comma-separated route patterns to archive, such as `/api/v1/admin/*`. Archived requests are retained FIFO up to 1000 rows. |

Docker Compose reads `.env.example` and overrides `DATABASE_URL` so the backend
connects to the `postgres` service.

## Vault States

The vault lifecycle consists of the following states:

| State | Description | Triggered By |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `Funding` | Initial state. Vault accepts deposits and aims to meet funding target before deadline. | Vault creation via factory |
| `Active` | Funding target met before deadline. Vault is operational and distributes yield. | Operator calls `activate_vault` after funding deadline passes with target met |
| `Matured` | Funding period ended. No new deposits accepted; yield distribution and redemptions continue. | Operator calls `mature_vault` |
| `Cancelled` | Funding deadline passed without meeting target. Depositors can withdraw refunds. | Operator calls `cancel_funding` (via `cancel_funding` event) |
| `Closed` | Vault fully wound down. All shares redeemed or refunded. | Operator action |

### Retrieving Cancelled Vaults

To fetch all cancelled vaults via the API:

```bash
GET /api/v1/vaults?state=Cancelled
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "contractId": "CDLZFC3SYJYHZDQA6M57EYUC2XBDA6LQF3M6KFRDZ7TXJYJL2K3B",
      "state": "Cancelled",
      "totalAssets": "0",
      "totalSupply": "0",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

## Full-Text Search

The API supports PostgreSQL full-text search for efficient vault discovery by name or symbol. The search uses:

- **GIN index** on a generated `tsvector` column for fast indexed queries
- **Relevance ranking** via `ts_rank()` to return most relevant results first
- **English language dictionary** for stemming and stop-word removal

### Search Query Parameter

Use the `q` parameter with `GET /api/v1/vaults` to search:

```bash
GET /api/v1/vaults?q=bond
```

This returns vaults containing "bond" in their name or symbol, ranked by relevance.

### Search Behavior

- **Empty or missing `q`**: Returns all vaults with standard sorting
- **With `q`**: Filters by search match and ranks by relevance (`ts_rank`)
- **Combines with filters**: Works alongside `state`, `page`, `pageSize`, etc.

### Examples

Search for "bond" vaults:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/vaults?q=bond"
```

Search active "treasury" vaults:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/vaults?q=treasury&state=Active"
```

Search with pagination:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/vaults?q=yield&page=1&pageSize=10"
```

### Implementation Details

- Search column: `search_vector tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(name, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(symbol, ''))) STORED`
- Index: `CREATE INDEX idx_vaults_search_vector ON vaults USING GIN (search_vector)`
- Query: `WHERE search_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('english', $q)`
- Ranking: `ORDER BY ts_rank(search_vector, plainto_tsquery('english', $q)) DESC`
